This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Start with :

yarn start

NOTE : this app has a default that I'll had to fix later on. When the operation is done, you can't apply a new operator to the result, you have to delete the displayed number and do the operation again ... what a shame !
I could also add a @keyaccess to the machine.
